1.Data visualization

2.Using principal component analysis (PCA) for real datasets namely binaryalphadigs.mat and 20news_w100.mat

3.Implementing different clustering techniques such as k-means,  KNN, k-medoids, min-max cut clustering, DBSCAN or any other hierarchical or Partitional clustering.

4.Identification of number of clusters in each dataset (simple â€“ but has to identify automatically through clustering metric). 

5.Using clustering metric to perform computation. 

6.Evaluation using ground truth labels.
